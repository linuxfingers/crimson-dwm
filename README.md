Minimalistic dwm config for OpenBSD with transparency effects using only **compton**. My goal was to only edit the config.h and dwm.c files to achieve what I was looking for to minimize overhead. Settings currenly allow all apps aside from Firefox to have transparency. Planetary symbols used for desktop tags; feel free to change the unicode to suit your needs.
